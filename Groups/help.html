      <p>Google Groups contains the entire archive of Usenet discussion groups 
        dating back to 1995. These discussions cover the full range of human discourse 
        and provide a fascinating look at evolving viewpoints, debate and advice on 
        every subject from politics to technology. Google's search feature enables 
        users to access this wealth of information with the speed and efficiency 
        of a Google web search, providing relevant results from a database containing 
        more than 600 million posts.

          links from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011217182809/http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups homepage</a>. 
          You should see a listing of recent threads from that group, ordered

          thread; you can scroll up or down to see the complete thread. </p>

        <p>No. Google Groups provides web based access to Usenet. You cannot use

          search page</a> lets you restrict your search to pages in a given newsgroup 
          or newsgroup hierarchy. To find all pages in a given newsgroup hierarchy, 
          use the * notation to denote "all pages in this hierarchy". For example, 
          to find pages within the comp.os hierarchy, enter "comp.os.*" (without 
          the quotation marks) in the newsgroup section of the advanced search 
          page. </p>
        <p>You can also search for group names containing a particular word -- 
          just type that word into the 'Newsgroups' box on the advanced search 
          page. For example, to search for all groups whose name includes "forsale", 
          just type "forsale" into the 'Newsgroups' box. This would then find 
          articles from groups such as "alt.ads.forsale", but would not find articles 
          in a hypothetical group "alt.ads.everythingforsale". </p>
        <b> 
        <li><a name="moderated"></a>What is a moderated group? Can I post to moderated 
          groups through Google?</li>
        </b> 
        <p> Newsgroups can be `unmoderated' (anyone can post) or `moderated'(submissions 
          are automatically directed to a moderator, who edits or filters and 
          then posts the results). Posting to moderated groups via Google Groups 
          is allowed, but such posts will be sent to the group's moderator for 
          approval rather than automatically propagated to the rest of Usenet. 
          Only if the moderator approves and propagates your post will it later 
          appear on Google Groups.</p>
        <p>If you crosspost a message(post the same message in more than one group), 
          and one of the groups is moderated, the message will ONLY be sent to 
          the moderator of the moderated group. It is up to the moderator to decide 
          if the message should be propagated - even to the unmoderated groups 
          on the list.</p>
        <p>Because messages will not be propagated until approved by a group's 
          moderator, Google cannot ensure that your post will appear in a timely 
          manner. This is entirely within the control of the group's moderator.

        <p> A &quot;thread&quot; is a collection of followups to an article, sequentially 
          ordered by posting date. Each search result or Usenet article is tagged

        <li><a name="archive"></a>How far back does Google's archive go?</li>
        </b> 
        <p> Google has fully integrated the past 20 years of Usenet archives into 
          Google Groups, which now offers access to more than 700 million messages 
          dating back to 1981. We believe this to be the most complete collection 
          of Usenet articles ever assembled and a fascinating first-hand historical 
          account. </p>
        <b> 
        <li><a name="updated"></a>How often is the newsgroup archive updated?</li>
        </b> 
        <p> The archive is currently updated several times per day. There may 
          be a delay of up to 12 hours between articles being posted to a news 
          server and those articles being searchable within Google's newsgroup 
          search. We realize this is less than ideal, and we hope to increase 
          the frequency of updates in the near future.</p>
        <b> 
        <li><a name="binary"></a>Can I access binary content on Google Groups?</li>

        <p> No. Google Groups does not archive any binary content. </p>

          can I prevent messages that I post from being archived on Google Groups?</li>
        </b> 
        <p> Google supports the 'X-No-archive: yes' header, and we will not archive 
          any articles that contain this text either in the header or in the first 
          line of the message body. </p>

        <li><a name="9"></a>How can I remove articles from Google's archive?</li>
        </b> 
        <p> Google will honor requests to remove messages that you have posted 
          yourself (known as nuking a post). You may even be able to do this yourself 
          using our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011217182809/http://services.google.com:8882/urlconsole/controller">Automatic

        <ul>

            <p>If the email address you used to post your message(s) is still

              be able to send and receive email using the same account from which 
              your messages were originally posted to Usenet.</p>
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Messages posted by other people</b> 
            <p>By its very nature, Usenet consists of information posted by many 
              people. Google does not monitor or control the content of this information. 
              Instead, we simply provide access to the public forum in which people 
              post their comments. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> Accordingly, if you are concerned about a message that someone has 
            posted, you need to resolve that problem directly with the person 
            who posted it. Except in extreme circumstances, Google will not act 
            upon an individual's request to remove another person's messages. 
            We firmly believe it is not Google's role to resolve disputes among 
            the users who have posted millions of messages on Usenet, nor would 
            it be possible to fulfill that role if we chose to undertake it. </p>

        <p>Send a message to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011217182809/mailto:groups-support@google.com">groups-support@google.com</a> 
          that includes the name of the newsgroup you would like to have added 
          to the archive. Your request will be reviewed, and if it's accepted, 
          the newsgroup will be added within a few days. Each request is evaluated 
          to determine the value of the information the newsgroup contains, but 
          there are no guarantees that a given newsgroup will be added. Please 
          do not send more than one request to add a particular newsgroup as this 
          slows the evaluation process and does not affect the ultimate outcome. 
        </p>
        <p><i>Note:</i> Google maintains an archive of messages posted to Usenet, 
          but we do not create the newsgroups that appear there. That is done 
          through a process <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011217182809/http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Lab/6882/ncreate.html">described 
          in detail here</a>. Once your newsgroup has been officially created 
          and approved by the usenet community, you can request that it be added 
          to the archive in Google Groups. It's important to note that Google 
          cannot add newsgroups that are only available on one specific news server, 
          unless the administrator of that news server decides to propagate those 
          newsgroups throughout the world-wide usenet.
